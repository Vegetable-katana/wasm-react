/// Implement this trait on a struct to create a component with the struct as
/// props. The props struct has to be `'static`.
///
/// The props will be completely controlled by Rust, which makes rendering them
/// relatively simple in Rust. However, since the props struct cannot be
/// constructed in JS, these components cannot be exposed to JS. This means only
/// components written in Rust can render a `Component`.
///
/// **Warning:** Do not create multiple components with the same name!
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// struct Counter(i32);
///
/// impl Component for Counter {
///   fn name() -> &'static str {
///     "Counter"
///   }
///
///   fn render(&self) -> VNode {
///     h("div").build_with(children!["Counter: ", self.0])
///   }
/// }
/// ```
